## Q1: Process

**a)**

State: New, Ready, Running, Blocked, Terminated

Transition:

-   New => Ready: admit the process to execution
-   Ready => Running: process is selected by the scheduler
-   Running => Blocked: process is interrupted by I/O devices
-   Blocked => Ready: I/O operation has finished
-   Running => Ready: processes is interruped by process with higher proirty or runs out of time slice
-   Running => Terminated: process has finished

**b)**

Context Switch: CPU saves the state of the old process and load the state of a new process, and creates overhead

Detailed steps

1.   Interruption or system calls
2.   Save the context of the current process
     -   save CPU state like PC into PCB
     -   save memory state
     -   save process state
3.   Scheduler selects the next process
4.   Load the context of the new process
     -   restore CPU state: load PC, stack pointer..
     -   restore memory state
     -   change process state into RUNNING
5.   Execute the new process

**c)**

1.   Use `test_and_set` atomic hardware operations to achieve mutexes
2.   Dynamic partitioning uses base registers and bound registers inside main memory

**d)**

Kernel level threads

1.   It allows multiple threads to run in parallel on multiprocessors
2.   It achieves true parallelism since

**e)**

3 processes would be created.

```C
#include <sys/types.h> 
#include <unistd.h> 
#include <stdio.h> 
#include <stdlib.h>

#define NUMBER_OF_PROCESSES 2
int cnt = 0;

int main() {
    pid_t pid = 0; 
    for(int i = 0; i < NUMBER_OF_PROCESSES; i++) {
        cnt += 1;
        pid = fork();
        if(pid < 0) { 
            printf("Could not create process\n"); 
            exit(1);
        } else if(pid == 0) { 
            printf("Hello from the child process\n");
        } 
    }
}
```

| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Mono-programming                | No protection needed between processes | Low utilisation of CPU |
| Fixed partition with equal size | simple implementation                  | internal fragmentation |
| Dynamic partitions              | reduces internal fragmentation         | external fragmentation |
| Paging                          |                                        |                        |

**b)**

**c)**

Mutex problem based on busy waiting

-   Since the critical section is short, the process holds the lock for a very short time
-   Busy waiting avoids the overhead caused by semaphores and system calls, so the lock would be released quickly
-   Busy waiting is suitable for multi-core machine since when a core is occupied by busy waiting, other cores could keep working

**d) (i)**

priority inversion: 

-   P2 first gets access to the shared  resources and calls `sem_wait(&sem)`.
-   Then P1 is turned to READY state
-   P1 can only get access to the shared resources when P2 finishes and calls `sem_post(&sem)`
-   Therefore P1 with higher priority has to wait util P2 with lower prioirty finishes

**f)**

9426, 0, page fault

## Q3

**a)**

Principle: Virtual memory and memory abstraction. The program only deals with the logical address and the OS would translate the logical address into physical address

The logical memory is always much larger than the actual physical memory

Procedures of address relocation for virtual memory

1.   Extract page number from logical address
2.   The page table maps the page number to the frame number of physical address
3.   The OS adds the offset to the base address to generate the true physical address

**b)**

1.   Mutual Exclusion: Only one process can access the shared resources
2.   Hold and wait condition: After accessing shared resources, a process could require for new resource
3.   No preemption: Resources could not be forcely taken away from a process
4.   Circular wait: There is a list of processes waiting for resources. The resource that is held by a process is required by another process in the list.

**c)**

The child process would have its own table



**d)(i)**

The page size is 4KB = 2^13, so the offset would take 13bit, leaving page number with 29 bit.

So the page number would be 2^29

**d)(ii)**

If each frame size is 4KB, then it will have 2^20 entries

**d)(iii)**

15ns + 90*0.98 + 90 *4 *0.02

**f)**

-   first fit: b, a, e
-   next fit: b, c, e
-   best fit: c, f, e

## Q4

**a)**

Thrashing occurs when pages are swapped out and loaded back immediately

Cause: 

-   too high multi-programming 
-   the average working set is too large

Prevention:

-   Add more memory
-   Use better page replacement algorithm
-   reduce the level of multi-programming

| --------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Contiguous            | easy implementation                     | Delete a file causes external fragmentation   |
| Linked List           | no external fragmentation               | Lost files if one file is broken              |
| File Allocation Table | Fast random access                      | The size of the table grows with file numbers |
| I-node                | Inode contains file control permissions | The number of inode is limited                |

**e)**

120 round per second => 8.3 ms per round => rotation latency: 4.2ms

-   Page fault time
    -   seek time = 25ms
    -   rotational delay = 4.2ms
    -   transfer time = 8.3ms
    -   page fault time = 25 + 4.2 + 8.3 = 37.5ms
-   Actual access time
    -   page fault rate = 0.001
    -   page access time = 150ns
    -   actual access time = 150ns * 0.999 + 37.5ms * 0.001 = 149.85 + 37.5 * 1000ns = 37649.85
-   Slow down = (37649.85 - 150) / 150 = 24999%
