## Q1

A. 293

B. 

-   Meta-heuristic performs search over space of solutions while hyper-heuristic performs search of low-level heuristics
-   Meta-heuristic could be used to designed the hyper-heuristic and it could also serve as a low level heuristic 

## Q2

A.

-   Largest Enrolment First
-   Choose the course with largest students enrolment first

B.

| Time  | Room1 | Room2 |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 2-3pm | 1     | 6     |
| 3-4pm | 4     |       |
| 4-5pm | 5     | 2     |
| 5-6pm | 7     | 3     |

## Q3

A.

-   Bit-flip
-   Adjacent Swap

B.

-   $2^N$

C.

-   Delta evaluation calculates the differences between current search position s and a neighbour s' on the evaluation function value.
-   Suppose we use bit-flip operator on kth bit, using delta evaluttion, the new value would be old value + k value if kth bit is turned to 1 or old value - k value if kth bit is turned to 0. We don't have to evaluate the whole representation again.

D.

-   [3, 5, 1], weight = 18, value = 26

E.

**First Descent**

-   Current solution: [1,0,0,0,1], weight = 13, value = 18
-   Flip i1: weight = 10 < 20, value = 14 < 18, reject
-   Flip i2: weight = 17 < 20, value = 23 > 18, accept
-   Current solution: [1,1,0,0,1], weight = 17, value = 23
-   Flip i3: weight = 23 > 20, reject
-   Flip i4: weight: 20 = 20, value = 25 > 23, accept
-   Current solution: [1,1,0,1,1], weight = 20, value = 25
-   Flip i5: weight = 10 < 20, value = 11 < 25, reject
-   Solution [1,1,0,1,1], weight = 20, value = 25

**Best Descent**

-   Current Solution: [1,0,0,0,1], weight = 13, value = 18, bestValue = 18
-   Flip i1: weight = 10 < 20, value = 14 < 18, reject
-   Flip i2: weight = 17 < 20, value = 23 > 18, accept, bestValue = 23
-   Flip i3: weight = 18 < 20, value = 26 > 23, accept, bestValue = 26
-   Flip i4: weight = 16 < 20, value = 20 < 26, reject
-   Flip i5: weight = 4 < 20, value = 4 < 26, reject
-   Solution [1,0,1,0,1], weight = 18, value = 26

## Q4

A.

-   Chromosome length: M, representing each surgeries
-   Representation: integer encoding, using an array of pair of integers of length M, one presenting the period assignment ranging from 1 to T and one representing the room assignment ranging from 1 to R
-   Objective function: the number of conflicted surgeries
-   Initialisation: when initialising each solution, we divide it into M steps. For each step k, we randomly select one of the two construcive heuristics h#1 and h#2, find the value for bit k and move to the next step.
-   Genetic operators: 
    -   Crossover: 1Point Crossover, Order Crossover
    -   Mutation: Exchange Mutation, Insertion Mutation and Reversion Mutation
-   Parent Selection: Roulettes Wheel Selection
-   Replacement: Elitism
-   Move Acceptance: Simulated Annealing with Geometric Cooling strategy
-   Termination criteria: when the maximum number of iteration is achieved

B.

-   A deterministic local search would easily get stuck in a local optimum. 
-   So we need to use metaheuristic to get out of local optimum using a stochastic move acceptance like simulated annealing.

C.
