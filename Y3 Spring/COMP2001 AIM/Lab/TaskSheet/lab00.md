## Q1

What would be the **objective value** of a solution to the above example problem instance with the representation “**000**”? Remember to discuss your answers with your peers either in the lab or via the Moodle discussion forum, alternatively you can ask one of the lab helpers if you are unsure.
$$
(A \or \neg B) \and (B \or C)\and (\neg A \or \neg C)
$$

## Q2

What would be the objective value of a solution to the above example problem instance with the representation “110” if we were using the minimisation objective function?

-   0

## Q3

What was the objective value of the best solution obtained in each of the three different trials? What do you notice about these and why might this happen?

-   0

## Q4

What happens if you change `m_seeds` to contain a single seed value? Why might this be a bad idea for experimental design?

-   The experiment would only be run once
-   The number of experiments are so small, thus we may miss the optimal result

## Q5

What happens if you use different seed values for all three trials? Referring to the `RandomWalk` search method, what effect does using a different seed value have on the search across each of the trials?

-   There would be three different output
