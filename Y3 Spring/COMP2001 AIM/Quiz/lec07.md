## Q1

Select the option(s) below indicating the characteristic(s) of a hyper-heuristic.

Select one or more:

-   a. A hyper-heuristic does not require a candidate solution representation.
-   b. A hyper-heuristic targets to exploit the strengths and avoid the weaknesses of the low level operators.
-   c. A hyper-heuristic is a parameterless search method.
-   d. A hyper-heuristic operates over the search space of low level heuristics.
-   e. A hyper-heuristic is an atomic move operator.

##  Q2

The hyper-heuristics can be broadly categorised as **Generation** hyper-heuristics that automatically construct new heuristics from given components, while **Selection** hyper-heuristics that choose and control a predefined set of heuristics. **Offline** learning hyper-heuristics are usually trained on a set of selected instances and then generalise to unseen instances, while **Online** learning hyper-heuristics receive feedback during the search process while solving a given instance of a problem



## Q3

Assume that you have applied a hyper-heuristic for 50 trials, managing a set of 9 low-level heuristics from LLH1 to LLH9, to a set of Vehicle Routing Problem instances denoted as VRP and obtained the following PieChart reporting the share of improvements produced by each low-level heuristic overall.

Is the following statement TRUE or FALSE?

This hyper-heuristic might be a method generated by a generation hyper-heuristic.

-   **True**
-   False 

## Q4

Is the following statement TRUE or FALSE?

The performance of this hyper-heuristic would definitely be the same if the experiments are repeated removing the low-level heuristics LLH1, LLH5, and LLH6 from the set.

-   True
-   **False** 

## Q5

Is the following statement TRUE or FALSE?

LLH9 generates the lowest number of improvements overall.

-   True
-   **False** 

## Q6

The majority of the selection hyper-heuristics managing perturbative low-level heuristics usually contain **heuristic selection and move acceptance methods**

## Q7

The following table provides Formula 1 scores of the top nine hyper-heuristics among CHeSC finalists and Robinhood hyper-heuristic (RHH) across six problem domains, where TOT denotes the total score.

Which of the following conclusion(s) below can be driven based on this table?

Select one or more:

-   **a. Robinhood hyper-heuristic delivers the best performance for the BP and VRP domains when compared to its performance on the other domains.**
-   b. Robinhood hyper-heuristic is the worst performing method among the other hyper-heuristics for TSP.
-   **c. Robinhood hyper-heuristic has a better cross-domain performance than six of the CHeSC finalists.**
-   d. AdapHH is the best hyper-heuristic ranking the top in all domains.
