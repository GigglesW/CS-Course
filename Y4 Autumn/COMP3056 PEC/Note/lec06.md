- Self-reflection on unconscious bias
- UNNC strategy and policy on EDI

## EDI

### EDI in Engineering

- Equity, Diversity and Inclusion are becoming increasingly important in Engineering.
- EDI in the workplace.
- EDI in engineering, design and innovation.

### EDI in the Work Space

- Diverse workplaces increase the skill set of the team.
- “The most diverse companies are now more likely than ever to outperform less diverse peers on profitability.”
    - McKinsey & Co. Report, Diversity wins: How inclusion matters, 2020
- Clear and fair treatment of all employees makes the workplace a more attractive and positive place to work.
- Diversity of employees leads to better decisions.

### EDI in Design and Development

- Embracing EDI into our engineering solutions, so that everyone can enjoy and participate in our products and technologies.
- When designing, think about groups who may have difficulty using it. … Awareness
- Create focus groups and talk with people who may need special arrangements to use your product or design.
