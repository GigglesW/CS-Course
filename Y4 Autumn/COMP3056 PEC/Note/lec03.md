# lec03: Ethics in Computing

[toc]

## Impact of Computing

- Safety critical systems such as airplane control systems have a direct impact on human experience.
- But any computer system can have a **negative impact** on people: even an accounting system
- Ethics is needed to ensure that we deploy computer systems that are a **positive experience** for people and not harmful.
- Software developers and computer engineers have a responsibility to ensure ethics in computing.

## Some common ethical principles in Computing

- Contribute **positively** to society and human well-being
- Be honest, transparent and trustworthy.
- Maintain professional competence for yourself and other coworkers.
- Respect data **privacy** and intellectual property rights.
- Be fair, do not discriminate, and take action against discrimination.

## Ethical dilemmas and critical reasoning

- Codes of Ethics in Computing are valuable since they deal with ethical issues you may encounter specifically in computing.
- In this module, we will focus on the BCS Code of Conduct. Key principles 
    - Public interest

    - Professional competence and integrity

    - Duty to relevant authority

    - Duty to the profession

## Why don’t we always do the “right” thing?

- We may do the wrong thing by **mistake or ignorance**; e.g. introduce a bug
- We may do the wrong thing because we are **intentionally bad**.
- **Relativism**. We may not agree on what is “right”.
- **Coercion**. People may be **deliberately forced** to do something unethical, but in modern world it will be more subtle: peer pressure, or managerial pressure, withholding of benefits, blackmail and so on.
- People are more complex than simply “good” and “evil”!
