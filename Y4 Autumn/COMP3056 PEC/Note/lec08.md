# lec08: Intellectual Property

## Intellectual & Intangible Property

**The basic idea / argument…**

- The importance of creativity and invention
    - Protecting innovators and their creation
- Ultimately to encourage innovation
    - But does the opposite happen?
- Defining intellectual and intangible property
    - Intellectual property often shortened to IP

**Intellectual Property (IP) Law**

- To ensure that people with good ideas can profit from them
    - even once the idea is known to everyone
- To encourage people to get involved in creative arts and invention
    - for the benefit of everyone
- We focus on three key aspects that directly affect computing
    - Copyright
    - Patent
    - Trademark

**IP Protection: 5 key questions**

1. What type of thing can be protected?

2. What rights are reserved for the creator of the work?

3. What rights are reserved for the public?

4. How does one obtain protection for a work?

5. How long does the protection last?

## Copyright

- Main mechanism for **protecting creative works**, e.g., art, music, & literature
- US Law DOES **PROTECT**:
    - Original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression

- US Law DOES **NOT PROTECT**:
    - Ideas, facts, or common knowledge
    - Creative works that are not in a “tangible” fixed form
    - E.g., dance choreography: to protect work, choreographers often make video recordings of dance during rehearsal

- Duration – (Currently) Lifetime of the author + 70 years

### Four main rights for the author

1. The right to **reproduce** the copyrighted work

2. The right to **prepare derivative works** based on the copyrighted work

3. The right to **distribute copies** of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending

4. The right to **perform or display** the copyrighted work publicly

### Rights for the public

- There are two main rights reserved for public that deserve special attention:
    - **Fair Use**
    - **First Sale**

### Factors of Fair Use

- Purpose and character of use
    - e.g., commercial vs. non-profit educational 
    - noncommercial and educational more likely to be fair
- Nature of the copyrighted work
    - e.g., fiction vs. nonfiction, published vs. non-published 
    - use of nonfiction work & published work more likely to be fair
- Amount and substantiality of used material
    - relative to the copyrighted work as a whole
    - short extracts more likely to be fair, but not if substantial
- Effect of use on potential market for, or value of, the copyrighted work
    - use more likely fair if copyright holder’s ability to make money is not damaged

### Doctrine of First Sale

- Copyright Law:
    - **Designed to protect something intangible** (i.e. an expression of creativity)
    - Until recently, copyrighted material was purchased in tangible form
        - Right to listen to music recording: purchase physical record, or CD
        - Right to read a novel: purchase printed copy of the book
- This creates confusion in minds of consumers—it’s natural to think same set of rules (about resale and copying) apply to CDs and books as to shovels, but that is not the case…

### Digital Rights Management (DRM)

- Digital Right Management (DRM):
    - Technologies that work to ensure copyrighted content can only be viewed by the purchaser
    - When you purchase content it is locked to your device
    - ebook purchased for your Amazon Kindle cannot be read on your friend’s Kindle

## Patent Law

### Definitions

- **Intellectual works of invention, value is on its usefulness**

    - Covers processes, machines, manufacture, compositions of matter, …
    - Capable of being made or used

- **Need to apply for it**

    - Can be expensive process (more than $10,000)

- **Criteria, invention must be:**

    - **Novel** (not been invented before)
    - **Non-obvious** (not obvious to another specialist in appropriate area)

- **Valid for some fixed period of time**

    – (usually 20 years from application date)

## Trademark

### Definitions

**Legal registration of word, phrase, symbol, or item that identifies product, service or corporation**

- **Trademark vs. Brand:**
    - Brand refers to the product’s identity as a whole
    - Trademark refers to specific element of identity elements
- Usually used to protect word or logo related to a product, so that consumers can be sure products are authentic
- Can register trademark for identifying characters of brand, e.g.,
    - **Colours**: T-Mobile holds trademark for colour magenta
    - **Sounds**: Motorola holds trademark on the “Chirp” sound phones make when using direct-connection technology
    - **Shapes**: Coca-cola holds trademark on “bottles, jars, or flasks with bulging, protruding or rounded sides”

### Trade Secrets

- With some products it is possible to keep the intellectual “idea” secret
    - E.g., an Internet company’s search algorithm
    - E.g., Coca Cola’s secret recipe
- **Such secrets are called “trade secrets”**
