## Theories of Privacy

### Definitions of Privacy

**Three dictionary definitions**

- Seclusion (being set apart, or out of view)
- Secrecy or concealment
- Freedom from intrusion

> **Scenario**
>
> You post your phone number on an online forum and shortly afterwards you start to receive harassing calls.
>
> Harassing calls are immoral, but do they violate your privacy?
>
> - If privacy is seclusion or secrecy, then perhaps not - it was your responsibility to keep your phone number secret.
> - If privacy is freedom from intrusion, then harassing calls are invading your privacy.

### Warren & Brandeis’s argument

- Opponents state that “privacy” derives from other rights:
    - **Implicit contract:** 
        e.g., a department store that video records you in the changing rooms is violating an implicit contract with you not to record, rather than violating a separate right to privacy.
    - **Intellectual property:**
        e.g., your friend posts an embarrassing picture of you on WeChat and tags you – this violates your intellectual property rights to your pictures of yourself and not a violation of your privacy.
- Warren & Brandeis debunked this; i.e., **“Privacy” is not protected by contracts and intellectual property**.
    - Using counter-argument of private letters published against wishes of the author to another person. The private letters are not covered by contract or intellectual property protection.

### Solove's Taxonomy of Privacy

- **Bottom Up approach:**
    - Impossible to adequately define “privacy” in a “top -down” way that covers all instances.
    - Identify instances of clear violations of privacy, and build up from there: a hierarchical Taxonomy of Privacy.

- **Information collection**
    - **Surveillance**: Monitoring continuously, usually via audio, visual, or computer technology.
    - **Interrogation**: “Pressuring... individuals to divulge information”
- **Information processing**
    - **Aggregation**: Collecting many small pieces of information about a person and linking them together, to create new information.
    - **Identification**: “Connecting information to individuals”.
    - **Insecurity**: Inadequately safeguarding collections of personal data against theft.
    - **Secondary Use**: Using data that people willingly gave for one purpose for some other purpose they did not approve.
    - **Exclusion**: Failing to notify individuals that their data is being collected, or failing to provide a way for individuals to view or correct such data.
- **Information dissemination**
    - **Breach of Confidentiality**: Breaking a contractual … duty to keep someone else’s information private.
    - **Disclosure**: Publishing private, but true, information in a way that damages the reputation of the subject.
    - **Exposure**: Publicly displaying certain physical or emotional attributes of another that are normally considered private, especially if such as display is humiliating or embarrassing.
    - **Increased Accessibility**: Making records that are technically available to the public easier to access.
    - **Blackmail**: Exerting power over another by threatening to reveal damaging information about that person.
    - **Appropriation**: Using someone else’s identity for one’s own ends.
    - **Distortion**: “Manipulat[ing] ... the way a person is perceived or judged by others” .
- **Invasion**
    - **Intrusion**: Communicating with people in a way that disturbs their peace or makes them feel uncomfortable.
        E.g. Phishing: a cybercrime that uses fake emails, websites, or messages to trick people into sharing personal or financial data.
    - **Decisional Interference**: Intruding into an individual's decision making regarding their private affairs.
