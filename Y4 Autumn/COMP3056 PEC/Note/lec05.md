## Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI)

### The AREA Framework

- **Reflect** – reflecting on the purposes of, motivations for and potential implications of the research.
- **Engage** – opening up such visions, impacts and questioning to broader deliberation, dialogue, engagement.
- **Act** – using these processes to influence the direction and trajectory of the research and innovation process itself.

### The 4 Ps

- **Process**: covers all activities in preparing research, undertaking data collection and analysis, storage and presentation of data and interaction with respondents.
- **Product**: can refer to products or services. It includes the consequences of use as well as misuse of research products and the impact that research has on the natural and social environment.
- **Purpose**: covers the question why research is undertaken at all.
- **People**: are at the heart of RRI and need to be explicitly considered.

### Limits of RRI

**RRI cannot**

- Predict the future
- Avoid all problems arising from research, innovation and technology development
- Eliminate value conflicts
- Relieve researchers / funders / industry from responsibility
- Be a panacea

**RRI can**

- Stimulate an intelligent conversation about R&I
- Facilitate second order reflexivity
