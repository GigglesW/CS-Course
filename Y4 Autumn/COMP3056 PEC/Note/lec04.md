# lec04: Professionalism and professional responsibilities

[toc]

## What is a profession?

**Characteristics of professions**

- Specialized Knowledge
- Formal Education and Training
- Ethical Standards
- Certification or Licensing
- Professional Associations
- Accountability
- Continuing Education

**What are professional ethics?**

> “**A set of morally permissible standards of a group** that each member of the group (at his/her rational best) wants every other member to follow even if their doing so would mean that he/she must do the same.” 
>
> Michael Davis, Profession, Code and Ethics. Burlington: Ashgate, 2001.

**Professional ethics - A subset of moral concerns**

- Morality is **much broader** in scope than professional ethics
- Morality encompasses societal reasoning and norms of conduct as to what constitutes right and wrong
- Professional ethics govern professional practice with respect to particular moral issues or challenges, e.g., algorithmic decisions
- As the broader social-moral order evolves so do professional ethics (ethics a matter of life-long learning)

## Permissible in general vs. Professional ethics

- It is against ethical standards in the USA for doctors to advertise prices for their services, but there is nothing inherently immoral about advertising prices for services
- This means that an action may be morally permissible but contravene professional professional standards
- Professional ethics requires that one **behaves consistently** with the standards of the group

**Professional standards consist of:**

- Principles
- Rules of conduct
- Embodied in codes of conduct or codes of ethics

**But what constitutes ‘professional activity’?**

- Provides an important service to society
- Requires extensive training 
- Involves significant intellectual effort 
- Organisation of members 
- Individual autonomy 
- Certification or licensing

## Is computing a profession?

- Lack of accreditation, certification or licensing
    - No single organisation of members for the computing profession
- The harms enabled by computing mean that people doing computing as a job of work still have important ethical obligations

## Computing codes of ethics: BCS, ACM, IEEE

**6 key areas of professional responsibility**

- General expectations of professional conduct 
- Exercise due diligence in professional work 
- Avoid discrimination (in the workplace and systems design and use) 
- Respect intellectual and intangible property 
- Always act in the public good 
- Whistleblowing

### General expectations

- You are generally expected to **uphold the profession**
- Unethical conduct includes:
    - Exaggerating skills and competences **(4b)**
    - Withholding or misrepresenting technical information **(3e)**
    - Conflicts of interest **(3b)**
    - Divulging confidential information **(3d)**
    - Dishonest conduct **(2g)**

### Due diligence

It is imperative that you **take reasonable care** in conducting your professional work

- You are competent to do the work required of you and your team **(2a 2c)**
- Appropriate steps are taken to avoid harm **(2f)**
- Systems are robust, secure and respect privacy **(1a)**
- Rules are followed **(3a)**
- Special care is taken when modifying or retiring systems or systems are integrated in societal infrastructure

### Avoid Discrimination

- A specific form of harm **(1c)**
    - Based on personal characteristics 
    - Harassment, abuse, oppression 
    - Examples of discriminatory systems

### Respect the work of others

**Two key aspects**

- Do no harm **(2f)**
- Respect intellectual property rights (IPR) **(1b)**

### Always act in the public good

- Central to professional conduct **(1a)**

### Whistleblowing

**The final recourse**

- What about your employer’s conduct?
    - Ethical codes are all about your conduct.
    - Incumbent on you to challenge unethical conduct.
    - Negligence by inaction not ethical.
    - Whistleblowing, legislation and public interest.
