## Types of Learning

- **Supervised (inductive) learning**
    - Training data includes **desired outputs**

- **Unsupervised learning**
    - Training data does not include desired outputs
    - This is the new frontier of machine learning because most big datasets do not come with labels

- **Semi-supervised learning**
    - Training data includes a few desired outputs
